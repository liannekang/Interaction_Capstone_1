			<h5>Racism in Fashion Industry</h5>
			<p class="fullpage1"> 
				I read an article about Fashion brands creating and representing racist imageries through their items and advertisements. Luxury brand Gucci had a black turtleneck sweater that represented the 'black face' imagery. Blackface is a form of theatrical make-up used predominantly by non-black performers in the 19th century to represent a caricature of a black person. Gucci eventually apologized and took down their sweater from the collection, but people were still upset about it.

			<h5>Other brands</h5>
			<p class="fullpage1"> 
				After reading the article, I searched for other brands that also upsetted people with racist imagery. Surprizingly Burbuerry, another luxury brand, apologized for sending a model down the runway at London Fashion Week wearing a hoodie with a noose around the neck. Dolce and Gabbana, already renowned for making racist statements, showed a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks. H&M also promoted a hoodie with "Coolest Monkey in the jungle" on, and made african american kid model to wear it.
