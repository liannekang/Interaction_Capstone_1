			<h5>jQuery Plugins</h5>
			<p class="fullpage1"> 
				This week, I discovered a website that has all sorts of jquery plugins for public use. jQuery plugin extends jQuery's prototype objects, which is default. Using the plugins that are already made by others, I can create a new jQuery object with functions that I want to use as well as all of the inherited jQuery methods. 
			</p>		
			<p class="fullpage1"> 
				I was looking for a jquery or javascript plugin for smooth scrolling effect. For my Design for Social Impact class, I had to create a single page website prototype. Since my prototype was based on mobile-screen, I had to go through a lot of libraries that were available on-line to check if the plugins worked on mobile. I have also noticed that a lot of plugins required license, in which I could buy it through their website. I often had error messages when I used the free code provided on their Github. 
			</p>

			<h5>fullPage.js</h5>	

			<p class="fullpage1"> 
			I found a plugin called "fullPage.js". I visited their Github, where I could download files and read instructions on how to use the plugin. Based on their descriptions, I was able to add required codes on my html, css, and js files. Although it was easy to use at first, I realized there were some codes that I did not recognize or understand. I had to frequently search the terms to customize the Plugin for my website. I would like to further look into different types of Plugins and try modifying them in my own website.
